# Focal
A chrome extension to boost your productivity

## Using the application
Focal lives on the Google Chrome store at https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nus-focal/hgoalcaldnhffibnncpgamalbkehopii?hl=en

## Development
1. Clone the repo to your machine

   `> git clone https://github.com/gnosis-agora/nus-focal.git`

2. Install the node modules

   `> npm install`
 
3. Compile the file

4. In Google Chrome, navigate to `chrome://extensions`. Ensure that developer mode has been enabled (with the small checkbox at the top-right of the window).

5. At the top of the window, click on 'Load unpacked extensions', and navigate to the `/build` folder that we created in step 3.

6. Open a new tab and you should see the extension running!
